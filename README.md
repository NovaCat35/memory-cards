# Memory Card [WORK IN PROGRESS]
A fun fan-project that draws inspiration from Genshin Impact's TCG card game, infused with the challenge of a memory-based brain teaser. As some wise but annoying puzzle ads out there once said: exercise your brain cells, and brace yourself for a wild ride. üß©

## Challenges
This project was all about putting together a full game experience while utilizing everything I have learned so far with hooks, contexts, managing components, and using data from external API on React. 

Somewhere along the project, I learned the hard lesson of uploading large files all at once. After several attempts and mishaps with github's LFS, I was finally able to save all my commit history and free up LFS quota by deleting and recreating a new repo after cloning all the old repos info. Lesson learned, stick to atomic commits with file uploads from now on and be careful with LFS.
