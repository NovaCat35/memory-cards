# Memory Card [WORK IN PROGRESS]
A fun fan-project that draws inspiration from Genshin Impact's TCG card game, infused with the challenge of a memory-based brain teaser. As some wise but annoying puzzle ads out there once said: exercise your brain cells, and brace yourself for a wild ride. üß©

## Challenges
This project was a deep dive into React, exploring hooks, contexts, and API integration for a complete game experience.

Somewhere along the project, a key lesson learned involved managing large file uploads. After grappling with GitHub's LFS, I ultimately saved commit history and cleared LFS quota by creating a new repo. This is a story of a cautionary tale of painstaking hours spent trying to make the game backdrop work. Lesson Takeaway: Opt for atomic commits with file uploads and handle LFS cautiously.
